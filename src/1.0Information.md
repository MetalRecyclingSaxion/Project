# Information
Project Overview: This project focuses on developing an automated system for sorting scrap metal using vision technology and robotics. The system integrates a vision-based detection mechanism, a conveyor belt, and a robotic arm to classify and sort various types of metals for recycling purposes.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Conveyor System: To move materials true out the system.
2. Vision System: Cameras for real-time object detection.
3. Robotic Arm: A 6-axis arm that interacts with materials based on vision system data.
4. Flipper: To puch material of conveyor system.
5. Documentation: Choices and why these have been made.
