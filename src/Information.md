# Information
Project Overview: This project focuses on developing an automated system for sorting scrap metal using vision technology and robotics. The system integrates a vision-based detection mechanism, a conveyor belt, and a robotic arm to classify and sort various types of metals for recycling purposes.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Automated Conveyor System: Powered by stepper motors for precise control.
2. Vision System: Cameras for real-time object detection.
3. Robotic Arm: A 6-axis arm that interacts with materials based on vision system data.
4. Technical Documentation: Comprehensive reports covering the entire project lifecycle.
