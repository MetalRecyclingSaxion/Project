# Safety Considerations

1. Physical Safety for Operators:

    - Enclosures & Barriers: Protect areas around the robot and conveyor.
    - Emergency Stops: Accessible buttons for immediate shutdown. 

2. System Safety Features:

    - Collision Sensors: Detect and prevent robotic collisions.
    - Overload Protection: Prevents handling weights above capacity.

3. Electrical Safety:

    - Grounding & Insulation: Reduces risk of electric shock.
    - Surge Protection: Safeguards against electrical fluctuations.

4. Monitoring & Alerts:

    - Real-Time Monitoring: Detects abnormalities early.
    - Automated Alerts: Notifies of temperature or sensor issues.

5. Maintenance & Training:

    - Routine Checks: Ensure all components work safely.
    - Operator Training: Covers operation and emergency protocols.

6. Environmental Control:

    - Dust Control & Ventilation: Keeps sensors clear and stable.
    - Temperature Regulation: Prevents overheating for reliable performance.
